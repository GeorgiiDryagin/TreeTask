# TreeTask User Guide

## 1. Getting Started
TreeTask is designed to help you focus. When you first open the app, you see the **Current Focus** view. This view is initially empty.

1.  **Create a Task**: Click the `+` button or `Create New Task`.
2.  **Break it Down**: If a task is too big (e.g., "Write Thesis"), click the `...` menu and select **Add Subtask**.
3.  **The Magic**: Notice that "Write Thesis" disappears from *Current Focus* and is replaced by the subtask. You are now unblocked!

## 2. Setting Goals (Strategic Alignment)
Navigate to **System** -> **Goals**.
*   **Concept**: Goals are the "Why". Projects are the "How".
*   **SMART Framework**: When creating a goal, you fill out 5 specific fields (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
*   **Linking Projects**: On the right side of the Goal window, you can search for and link existing **Root Tasks**.
*   **Progress**: The Goal card shows a progress bar. This bar represents the completion status of all linked projects combined.
*   **Note**: Infinite recurring tasks cannot be linked to goals, as they violate the "Time-bound" rule.

## 3. Managing Time & Context

### 📅 Calendar & Scheduling
The Calendar is the heart of time management in TreeTask.

*   **Drag & Drop**: Open the sidebar (Inbox icon). Drag unscheduled tasks onto the calendar grid to assign a time.
*   **Ghost Creation**: Click and drag your mouse vertically on any day column. A semi-transparent "Ghost" block will appear. Release the mouse to instantly create a **Time Block** or **Task** with that exact duration.
*   **Resize**: Grab the bottom edge of any task box in Day/Week view to change its duration.
*   **Spillover**: Tasks that start late at night and cross midnight will automatically render on the next day as well.

### 🧠 Context-Aware Focus
TreeTask changes what you see based on *when* it is.
*   **Green Halo**: If a task is scheduled for *right now* (Start Time ≤ Now ≤ End Time), it glows green.
*   **Context Boost**: If you create a Time Block (e.g., "Deep Work") and tag it "Work", any tasks with the type "Work" will automatically jump to the top of your list during that time.

## 4. Recurring Tasks & Habits
Navigate to the **Routine** tab.

*   **Persistent Overdue**: If you miss a daily task, it doesn't disappear at midnight. It stays "Overdue" until the *next* cycle is scheduled to start.
    *   *Example*: A 9 AM daily task stays visible until 9 AM the next day. Then it refreshes.
*   **Habits**: Use the "Habits" tab for simple check-off items. Click the chart icon to see success rates (last 7 days, 30 days, etc.).
*   **Editing**: When you edit a recurring task, you can choose to apply changes to "This Event Only" (creates a split), "This and Following", or "All Events".

## 5. Advanced Visualization

### 🌳 Forest View (Gamification)
Go to **System** -> **Forest**.
*   **Visual Progress**: Each project (root task) is a tree. As you add subtasks, the tree grows branches.
*   **Status**: Green leaves are active tasks. Gold/Orange leaves are completed tasks.
*   **Navigation**: Click on the **label** below a tree to enter **Focused View**. This filters the entire application (Current, All, Calendar) to show *only* that specific project.

### 🏗️ Task Management Tricks
*   **Root Drop Zone**: In the "All Tasks" view, drag a subtask towards the **far left** of the screen. A large "ROOT" drop zone will appear. Drop the task there to detach it from its parent and make it a top-level project.

### ⏱️ Analog Time Picker
When setting a time, TreeTask uses a custom radial clock.
1.  **Hours**: Click the clock face to select the hour.
    *   Outer ring = AM (00-11).
    *   Inner ring = PM (12-23).
2.  **Minutes**: The clock automatically switches to minute mode. Click to select minutes.

## 6. Organizing with Notes
Go to the **Notes** tab.
*   Use this as a "scratchpad" for thoughts.
*   **Convert**: Click `...` on a note to instantly convert it into a Task.
*   **Sort**: Move notes between Inbox, Someday, and Archive.

## 7. Debug / Time Travel
(Visible only if Debug Mode is enabled in Settings)
Use the **Dark Bar** at the top to simulate time passing.
*   Click **+1 Day** to fast-forward time.
*   See how recurrence triggers and how tasks become "Overdue".
*   Click **Reset** to return to real time.
